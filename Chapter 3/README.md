# Chapter 3
Notes: I always added a comma after the end of an include directive, you shouldn't do that in C++ ;)

### Try This 1
Try This 1 asked you to rewrite a name and age asking program to use `double` instead of `int` and give the date back in months.

### Try this 2
Try this 2 asked you to play with the operations you could perform on an `int` type.

### Try this 3
Try this 3 asked us to write the repeating word program

### Try this 4
Try this 4 asked us to run a faulty program and examine its errors:
Faulty program:
```cpp
#include "std_lib_Facilities.h"

int Main() {
    STRING s = "Goodbye, cruel world! ";
    cOut << S << '\n';
}
```

### Try This 5
Here you were asked to try the program in `Try This 5/main.cpp` with a few values to see how unsafe conversions work and what they do.

### Drill
Make a letter format
