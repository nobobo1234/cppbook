# Chapter 4

### Try This 1
Make a program that converts yen, kroner, or pounds into dollars. I've used euro's instead of dollars for this one ;)

### Try This 2
Convert the program from the previous try this into a program that uses a switch add yuan as currency.

### Try This 3
Use a while loop to write out a table of characters (in the alphabet) with their corresponding integer values

### Try This 4
Rewrite the previous program (from try this 3) using a `for`-statement. Also add a loop for the uppercase letters and digits.

### Try This 5
Implement a `square()` function using repeated addition

### Try This 6
Implement a word bleeper. E.g. if words `Hello my name is John Doe` is entered and you don't like the word `Hello` you bleep the word.
